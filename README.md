The data consisted of 5,000 unique teacher profiles with repeated annual observations to simulate
teacher career trajectories. Each instructor was associated with one of 300 schools, each located in
heterogeneous contexts defined by geographic location, type of school, and socioeconomic status of
student body. Teacher records held variables commonly found in district human resources systems
and in teacher questionnairesâ€”namely, level of education, number of years of experience, compen-
sation system, base salary, bonuses tied to performance, self-assessed job satisfaction and stress, and
retention status. Student-level outcomes were combined with school-wide average test scores and
expenditures per student, as with state report card data.
